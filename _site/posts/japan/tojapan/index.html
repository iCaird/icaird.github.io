<h1>Gatwick to Okinawa</h1>
<p>Ellis Caird </p>
<p>Created: 19-11-24</p>  
<p>I spent most of the night at the Premier Inn trying to figure out how websites work whilst a lovely man
on the TV tried to sell me a GX Pro GPS Mega Drone Bundle (GPS Drone + Case + 2 Extra Batteries).</p>

<p>I went to bed around 3AM and woke up at about 7 expecting to be able to meander downstairs and enjoy a lovely
breakfast. Liam informs me that the staff have told him I didn't choose breakfast when booking through clarity and
so I am forced to starve. Check-in and security were mostly uneventful apart from the fact I immediately left my boarding
pass at the bit where you put your stuff into trays. I only realised when one of the staff was wondering up and down with them as I was waiting for my bag. Said bag gets sent to the &quot;you might be in trouble side&quot; where someone has to talk to you. Turned out
to just be them wanting to see my inhaler since its a liquid and I hadn't put it in a plastic bag. Spoons breakfast awaited me on the other side of the copious amounts of duty-free fragrances and sunglasses.</p>
