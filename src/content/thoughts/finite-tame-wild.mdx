## Denial
There is a trichotomy in representation theory due to Drozd which roughly says
that the problem of understanding the (finite dimensional) representations of a finite-dimensional algebra
is either :green[finite], :orange[tame], or :red[wild].

- Finite type algebras have only finitely many indecomposable representations up to
isomorphism.
- Tame type algebras have infinitely many indecomposables but they can be classified
in a reasonable way. For a fixed dimension d, all but finitely many indecomposable representations
with dimension less than d are grouped into a finite number of one-parameter families. 
- Wild type algebras have infinitely many indecomposable representations up to iso
and the problem of classifying them is 'hopeless'. 

The use of the word 'hopeless' stuck with me when I first saw it used to describe
these wild problems. Initially it was because I didn't really know what they meant. 
Hopeless *how*? Are people just not trying hard enough? I did not believe that
these problems were truly hopeless like claimed.

I've used the analogy with the 5 stages of grief partly because it's a little amusing 
and partly because there is some truth to it. That then begs the question: *What* is
it that I'm grieving about? To grieve is to "feel intense sorrow" and sorrow is
"a feeling of deep distress caused by loss, disappointment, or other misfortune".
What misfortune have I suffered? What, if anything, have I *lost*?

One answer, perhaps, is that I have lost the belief that with
enough time and effort all of these problems could be understood completely. The
only justifications I had for believing such a thing 



Dramatic line <span style="display: inline-block; filter: url('#wobbleFilter')">about</span> the <span class="raised">fact</span>
 that my existential dread concerning wild problems was only
fully realised after actually working with a couple tame problems for a while:
:red[Only when you peek over the edge does the depth of the abyss become clear.]
