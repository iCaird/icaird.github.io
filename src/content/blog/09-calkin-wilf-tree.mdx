## Rational Thoughts

I recently found myself needing to understand the dynamics of the following two rational
functions during my research.[^1] Consider the suggestively named maps $L,R\colon \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ defined via
<center>

$$L(q) = \frac{q}{1+q},\quad R(q) = q+1.$$

</center>

Perhaps even more suggestively we could let $q = \frac{a}{b}$ and rewrite the definition as

<center>

$$L\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \frac{a}{a+b},\quad R\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \frac{a+b}{b}.$$

</center>

Have a play! Use the arrow keys in the sketch below to apply combinations of L and R to 1/1. Press
`r` to reset.

## Rational Questions

- Starting from 1, which rationals can we hit using combinations of L and R?
- Can we reach a rational in more than one way?

[^1]: I'm currently trying to understand the structure of the module category of a
tubular algebra. Regular modules have a notion of 'slope' which is just some 
rational number and determines a whole tubular family. Shrinking functors in the sense of Ringel allow you to pass between tubular families. They thus also act on slopes and the maps L and R are 
the induced maps for my two particular shrinking functors.
