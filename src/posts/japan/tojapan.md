I spent most of the night at the Premier Inn trying to figure out how websites work whilst a lovely man
on the TV tried to sell me a GX Pro GPS Mega Drone Bundle (GPS Drone + Case + 2 Extra Batteries).

I went to bed around 3AM and woke up at about 7 expecting to be able to meander downstairs and enjoy a lovely
breakfast. Liam informs me that the staff have told him I didn't choose breakfast when booking through clarity and 
so I am forced to starve. Check-in and security were mostly uneventful apart from the fact I immediately left my boarding
pass at the bit where you put your stuff into trays. I only realised when one of the staff was wondering up and down with them as I was waiting for my bag. Said bag gets sent to the "you might be in trouble side" where someone has to talk to you. Turned out 
to just be them wanting to see my inhaler since its a liquid and I hadn't put it in a plastic bag. Spoons breakfast awaited me on the other side of the copious amounts of duty-free fragrances and sunglasses.
